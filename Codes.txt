--------	Banking: Customer Churn Prediction
		Topic: Customer Churn Prediction in Retail Banking

		Tools Breakdown:

		SQL: Extract transactional data (account activity, login frequency, balance history).

		Python: Data cleaning, feature engineering, churn model with scikit-learn, and churn probability scoring.

		Power BI/Excel: Create dashboards to display churn likelihood, key customer segments, and risk factors.


----1. Segment Most Likely to Churn

		SELECT Age, Gender, MaritalStatus, COUNT(*) AS total, 
     		  SUM(CASE WHEN Churned = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS churned,
 		      ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN Churned = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) AS churn_rate
		FROM bank_customers
		GROUP BY Age, Gender, MaritalStatus
		ORDER BY churn_rate DESC
		LIMIT 10;

---- 2. Churn vs Digital Banking Usage

		SELECT DigitalBankingUser, 
       COUNT(*) AS total_customers,
       SUM(CASE WHEN Churned = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS churned_customers,
       ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN Churned = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) AS churn_rate
FROM bank_customers
GROUP BY DigitalBankingUser;


---- 3. Monthly Activity Impact on Churn (Python)
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

sns.boxplot(x='Churned', y='MonthlyAvgTransactions', data=df)
plt.title("Monthly Transactions vs Churn")
plt.show()


-----4. Impact of Product Holding on Churn
SELECT CreditCardHolder, LoanProductCount,
       COUNT(*) AS total,
       SUM(CASE WHEN Churned = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS churned,
       ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN Churned = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)*100.0/COUNT(*), 2) AS churn_rate
FROM bank_customers
GROUP BY CreditCardHolder, LoanProductCount
ORDER BY churn_rate DESC;


------5. Early Churn Signal Detection (Python + Time Analysis)

df['MonthsSinceLastTransaction'] = (pd.to_datetime("2024-12-31") - pd.to_datetime(df['LastTransactionDate'])).dt.days // 30

sns.histplot(data=df, x='MonthsSinceLastTransaction', hue='Churned', bins=20, kde=True)
plt.title("Months Since Last Transaction vs Churn")
plt.show()



------ 6. Revenue Loss from Churn

SELECT ROUND(AVG(AccountBalance), 2) AS avg_balance_loss,
       COUNT(*) AS churned_customers,
       ROUND(SUM(AccountBalance), 2) AS total_potential_loss
FROM bank_customers
WHERE Churned = 1;


-------7. Churn vs Complaint Volume or NPS

SELECT CustomerSatisfactionScore, 
       COUNT(*) AS total,
       SUM(CASE WHEN Churned = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS churned,
       ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN Churned = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)*100.0/COUNT(*), 2) AS churn_rate
FROM bank_customers
GROUP BY CustomerSatisfactionScore
ORDER BY churn_rate DESC;


-----8. Churn by Region

SELECT Region,
       COUNT(*) AS total_customers,
       SUM(CASE WHEN Churned = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS churned,
       ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN Churned = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)*100.0/COUNT(*), 2) AS churn_rate
FROM bank_customers
GROUP BY Region
ORDER BY churn_rate DESC;


-----9. Strategy for High-Income, Low-Engagement

SELECT CustomerID, Income, MobileAppUsageFrequency, Churned
FROM bank_customers
WHERE Income > 80000 AND MobileAppUsageFrequency < 2
ORDER BY Income DESC;


----10. Loyalty Program Effectiveness (Pre/Post Analysis)

-- Before Loyalty Program
SELECT 'Before' AS period,
       COUNT(*) AS total,
       SUM(CASE WHEN Churned = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS churned,
       ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN Churned = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)*100.0/COUNT(*), 2) AS churn_rate
FROM bank_customers
WHERE LoyaltyProgramDate < '2024-01-01'

UNION ALL

-- After Loyalty Program
SELECT 'After' AS period,
       COUNT(*) AS total,
       SUM(CASE WHEN Churned = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS churned,
       ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN Churned = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)*100.0/COUNT(*), 2) AS churn_rate
FROM bank_customers
WHERE LoyaltyProgramDate >= '2024-01-01';
